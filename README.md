* Student Picker Beginning Rails Project

* Description
Basic rails project allows you to add students, pick on them in class, and keep track of when they were last called.
A button to pick students allows the "teacher" to select a student who was not called on recently (i.e. today).
A button to add students allows the "teacher" to add a new student to the student list.
